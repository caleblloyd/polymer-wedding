            <wedding-story-item img-src="../images/story/hickory.jpg" section-title="The Lovely town of Hickory, NC">
                Maggie and Caleb met while Maggie was attending grad school in Hickory. Between hikes
                at Baker's Mountain and weekend escapes to Asheville, Caleb got a few ideas for the engagement.

            <wedding-story-item img-src="../images/story/flw.jpg" section-title="Distance can't keep love apart">
                Maggie was a frequent visitor to the great state of Missouri while Caleb went to Army Engineer School.
                Thankfully it is also home to the first Anheuser Busch brewery, so there was no shortage of fun!

                Whether it's a bike ride to the beach or a triathalon on the beach, Maggie and Caleb can be found
                charging through the pain to get to the finish line &ndash; where more often than not there's a cold
                beer waiting

            <wedding-story-item img-src="../images/story/vacations.jpg" section-title="Vacation, Anyone?">
                We've been to St. Louis, Hawaii, Vero Beach, Washington D.C., and Austin so far, with plans to go to
                Europe
                next summer for our honeymoon!

            <wedding-story-item img-src="../images/story/dog.jpg" section-title="Dog Family">
                The newest addition to our family, Austen, has grown from a 12lb puppy to a 62lb gentle beast over the
                past year.
                Her favorite pastimes include going to the bar and eating sticks and leaves.
